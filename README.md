# Research-Paper_01- Prediction of death rate among COVID-19 patients in the age group of 10 to 19 yrs. using machine learning.

ABSTRACT : 
COVID-19, a contagious disease which resulted in a worldwide pandemic just like “The Great Plague
of Marseille” in 1720, “The First Cholera Pandemic” in 1820, and “The Spanish Flu” in 1920, claimed
many lives. In December 2019 this disease was identified in the Chinese city Wuhan. After that
researchers have found many relationsin the ethnicity, occurrence, symptoms, severity, age and death.
The study of these factors and their co-relation has helped in identifying who are at a greater risk of
the disease and its repercussions.
In this paper, authors have predicted the death rate of COVID-19 patients (Sex, Current Status, ICU,
Medical Condition, Hospitalization) in the age group 10-19 years. Data has been analysed through
Logistic Regression Analysis (LR). The proposed model is tested on the “COVID19_Case_Surveillance_Public_Use_Data” from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
Keywords- Logistic Regression, Confusion Matrix, Methodology, 10Fold Cross Validation.
